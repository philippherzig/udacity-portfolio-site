# Portfolio Site

This portfolio website was created as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. It meets the requirements of the course and will be used to present personal web projects in the future.

## Concept

The projects are displayed as squares in a grid construct that dynamically adapts to the size of the browser. The title and description of the portfolio projects are overlayed on the image. On mobile devices the overlay is always displayed directly. On desktop sizes it appears only when the cursor moves over it.

## Specials

* Combined use of CSS Grid and Flexbox
* Integration of Google Fonts
* Use of transitions

## View

You can view the website directly via the following Github Pages link:
